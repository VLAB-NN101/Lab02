# Lab02
Lab 2 is about Linear Regression.  
Your goal is to learn `w` and `b` with the given training data, and pass the test case.  
In a given skeleton code, You can experiment your code with a simple example.  

    Actual scoring will be done with a hidden test case

There are 2 Problems you need to solve  

## Problem 1
Linear Regression - single variable  
For given `x_train`($x$) and `label`($y$), perform linear regression.  
Assume $y = wx + b$.

## Problem 2
Multiple Linear Regression - multiple variable  
For given `x_train`($\vec x$) and `label`($y$), perform linear regression.  
Assume $y = \vec x \cdot \vec w + b$.

Tip) Try to make general code.  
because Testcase has various size of $x_n$.

## Submission 
Just push you code to the repository created by github class.
